# Project Rebound

Project Rebound utilizes Hanno Rein 's N-body [simulation library](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound) for the purpose of simulation setup for systems within Project Nine ("Simulatione"). 
The immediate goal is to find stable configurations and predicted future trajections for the Doma and X13 systems. Consult P9 for more detailed definition on this project.

Notice due to the nature of a public fork, this repo is public. In that case, we should avoid referencing Project Nine contents and try to keep this repo a pure-simulation environment.

From a software-development perspective, the best way to utilize this is to: 1) Data-driven everything first, 2) Develop and package the software as a proper CLI tool. However, for the purpose of this project, we will just edit in-place and use as-is for immedaite needs. The "tooling" aspect can be done in a seperate fork.
